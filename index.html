        <figcaption>Created back in 2014, Katie's Koffee was created for people who love coffee. 
          I am a full time student who started with a part-time job, I bought coffee from many 
          different places daily and honesty it became too expansive. I wanted to create an 
          afforable coffee brand. I worked with coffee bean grows until I found the perfect beans for my 
          brand. I am still a full time student working toward my undergrad comp sci degree but I continue to 
          work toward expanding my comaany. As of right now my coffee is only sold online but I would love to 
          see my brand in stores.

          <p>As a college student it's so convient to make my coffee at home and avoid the step of having
